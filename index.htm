<h1>About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I'm 'Lud' and I have a big passion for creating art in all forms. I enjoy making music, drawing and writing, which you should be able to see throughout some of my projects. I'm a big nerd, and I've played piano since I was 10 or so. I'm in the process of learning HTML to put this stuff up for people to see, so this place is probably gonna be hella buggy.</p>
